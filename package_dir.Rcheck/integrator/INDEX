cmp_function_dependence
                        A comparator ('<=' equivalent) for quicksort.
db_connector-class      A reference class which always yields a valid
                        connection with x$conn.
dependency_resolver     Dependency resolver for function lists.
eval_pipe               Runs expressions from a list in an
                        independently scoped environment.
map                     Maps names in a list (or data frame) to new
                        names based on a mapping from a list (map).
map_unknowns            Maps special "NA" values to NA's in a vector.
map_values              Maps vectorvalues one-to-one.
pipeline                Applies a list of functions to a data frame in
                        order to transform columns.
quicksort               Sorting with an arbitrarily defined comparator
                        ('<=' by default).
quicksort.list          Sorting with an arbitrarily defined comparator
                        ('<=' by default).
safe_read_csv           Read a .csv file with minimal modifications as
                        allowed by R, then modify according to locally
                        sourced files.
standard_string_transformations
                        Standard strings transformations.
string_masks            Takes strings, check if they match patterns,
                        and construct expressions according to a
                        string.
string_pipeline         Runs a series of string-transforming functions.
